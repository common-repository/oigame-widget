oiga.me campaign widget for the sidebar. 

== Description ==

This is a widget for displaying [oiga.me](https://oiga.me) campaigns in a widget.

Oiga.me is a tool for citizenship mobilization through the net.

Oiga.me is a resource to generate online petitions and support campaigns, but also a platform for citizenship lobbying. Through a massive mailing contact functionality (and soon, a fax and IP telephone too) it serves as a catalyst of collective demands and petitions. Civil society individuals or organizations can communicate their petitions and demands straight to the responsible entitled such as governments, companies, local authorities or any other kind of representatives.

Oiga.me is a tool of social democratization and empowerment that serves as a mechanism to enhance voices and express demands.
